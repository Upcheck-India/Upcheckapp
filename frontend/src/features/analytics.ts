/**
 * Product analytics — dead until the farmer says yes.
 *
 * The Privacy Policy (src/legal/content.ts, section 6) says analytics "is
 * never enabled by default, never pre-ticked, and never inferred from your
 * silence", that switching it off "stops collection — it is not a preference
 * we quietly ignore", and that "your farm records, money and harvest data are
 * never sent to analytics, whatever your setting". Three properties, and this
 * file is where each of them is either true or a lie:
 *
 *  1. NOT STARTED, rather than started-then-disabled. `posthog-react-native`
 *     is `require`d inside `startAnalytics()` and nowhere else, so with no
 *     consent the SDK is never constructed, never imported for effect, and
 *     never touches the network or storage.
 *  2. Revoking consent SHUTS THE CLIENT DOWN — optOut, then shutdown, then the
 *     reference is dropped. A boolean guard alone would leave a live client
 *     with a queue.
 *  3. Properties go through an ALLOWLIST. `capture(event, props)` cannot be
 *     handed a whole pond/harvest/expense record, because anything not on the
 *     list is dropped before it reaches the SDK — a permissive `props: any`
 *     would make the third promise unenforceable by anything but discipline.
 *
 * No autocapture and no session recording: the plain client (not
 * `<PostHogProvider autocapture>`) captures only what is passed to it here.
