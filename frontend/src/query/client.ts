/**
 * The app's read cache.
 *
 * Until this existed nothing cached a GET, so "no signal" meant an error screen
 * on every screen — the farmer's own complaint. Every read now goes through
 * TanStack Query with an AsyncStorage-backed persister, so a cold start with no
 * bars paints the last-known data instead of a retry button.
 *
 * Three deliberate choices:
 *
 * 1. `networkMode: 'always'`. The default ('online') asks TanStack's
 *    `onlineManager`, which in React Native never sees a browser 'online' event
 *    and so reports online forever anyway — but worse, if it ever DID report
 *    offline the query would sit in `pending`/`paused` and a screen with no
 *    cache would show a skeleton that never resolves. We would rather the
 *    request go out, fail fast, and let the screen render cached-with-an-age or
 *    a real error. "Failed" must never look like "loading" or "empty".
 *
 * 2. Selective persistence. AsyncStorage on Android is one ~6MB SQLite blob and
 *    raising that ceiling needs a gradle property — i.e. a native rebuild, which
 *    this OTA-shipped app cannot do. So only the keys that make the first paint
 *    useful are written to disk (see PERSISTED_ROOTS); everything else is
 *    memory-only and simply refetches.
 *
 * 3. `gcTime` 24h so the persisted cache survives an app restart, `staleTime`
 *    30s so navigating back to a list within half a minute is instant rather
 *    than a spinner.
