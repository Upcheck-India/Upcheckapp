# Audit Remediation Status — 2026-07-08 (215 findings)

Source: `AUDIT_FINDINGS_2026-07-08.json` (workflow wf_73582cfd, not-converged, 215 confirmed).
Legend: ✅ done+tested / ⬜ pending / 🔷 needs-ops-or-external-input

**Session 1 done: all 6 CRITICAL + 22 HIGH (28 findings), backend 465/465 + frontend 120/120 green.**

**Session 2 done: remaining 5 HIGH closed (measurement offline queue wired through hardened `saveRecord` + dead `measurementSync.ts` deleted → fixes both the dead-module and lost-write-race findings; harvest mark-complete modal + i18n confirmed already fixed in Session 1; inventory Add-item real create form). tsc clean, frontend 120/120 green.**

> Note: the `#` column below is a row index, NOT the audit JSON `id`. HIGH ⬜ rows 24/27/28/29/37 = audit ids 82/86/69/71/127 respectively.

**Session 4 done (user-directed): EAS remote versioning + autoIncrement (#22/#23); backend Sentry wired behind `SENTRY_DSN` env — init + `SentryExceptionFilter` reports 5xx + crash-handler capture (#33); safe non-breaking `npm audit fix` (backend 45→10, frontend 36→19, both clear CRITICAL + most HIGH) (#31/#36); `eslint --fix` safe/formatting + non-blocking CI lint step (#7). CAVEATS: #74 store signing = EAS-account keystore via `eas credentials` (ops step, no keystore in repo); #38 frontend crash reporting left as the `reportError()` seam (needs `@sentry/react-native` native install by you, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`); #31/#36 residual advisories need breaking upgrades (deferred per your call). Backend 468/468, frontend 120/120, build+tsc clean.**

**Session 3 done: codeable ops-hardening (11 findings). helmet security headers + graceful shutdown hooks + process crash handlers (main.ts); health check now reports redis degraded/up and returns HTTP 503 when DB is down (+3 unit tests); @Throttle added to the 4 unthrottled public auth endpoints (login-otp/verify, oauth/google, oauth/truecaller, oauth/truecaller/exchange) + resend-verification now uses ResendVerificationDto; backend CI quality-gate workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs backend build+test and frontend tsc+jest on push/PR. Backend 468/468 green, build clean.**
