/**
 * Last-known-good GET responses, so the app stays readable with no signal.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT THE HTTP LAYER
 *
 * Only 7 of ~96 screens read through TanStack Query; the other 89 fetch
 * straight into `useState` and therefore had NO cache of any kind. Turning off
 * the network made those screens render "Cannot reach the server" instantly,
 * even for data the farmer had just been looking at — the app was offline-first
 * on paper and online-only in practice.
 *
 * Migrating 89 screens is not a change anyone should make in one go. Caching at
 * the axios layer fixes all of them at once, and the migrated screens are
 * unaffected because their own cache answers first.
 *
 * RULES
 *
 * - GET only. A failed write must still fail — writes go through the offline
 *   queue in src/sync/, which is what guarantees they eventually land.
 * - Only NETWORK failures are served from here. A 4xx/5xx is the server
 *   answering, and replacing a real error with stale data would hide it.
 * - Per user. `clearCachedReads()` wipes this on sign-out; without that, the
 *   next user on a shared phone would read the previous one's responses.
 * - Never other people's personal data (C5.4). AsyncStorage is an unencrypted
 *   SQLite file on Android; see `isPersonalDataUrl`.
