 * precisely what shipped: MemberDetailScreen called `members.transferCta`,
 * `members.transferTitle`, `members.transferConfirm` and `members.transferError`,
 * none of which existed in any locale. Parity passed. The farmer saw the raw
 * string `members.transferCta` rendered as the label of the button that hands
 * their farm to someone else.
 *
 * There is no fallback to rescue this: src/i18n/index.ts sets `fallbackLng: 'en'`,
 * so a key absent from English resolves to the key itself, in every language.
 *
 * Only STATIC keys are checkable. `t(\`ponds.${kind}\`)` is skipped by design —
 * this guards the common case cheaply rather than trying to be a type system.
