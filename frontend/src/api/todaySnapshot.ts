/**
 * Everything Today needs about ponds and alerts, in as few requests as the
 * deployed backend allows.
 *
 * The fast path is `GET /alert-center/today`, which computes each active pond's
 * context ONCE and returns the contexts alongside the alerts derived from them.
 * The screen used to call `live-briefing` (which computed those contexts and
 * discarded them) and then `pond-context?farmId=` per farm (which computed the
 * same contexts again) — measured at 54 database queries for a three-pond owner
 * and 79 for a worker, against a five-connection pool. One call is 25 and 31.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK IS THE POINT. The app ships as an OTA update and the backend
 * deploys separately, so for some window a phone will be running this code
 * against an API that has never heard of `/today`. Without the fallback that
 * window is a blank home screen. With it, the screen is merely as slow as it
 * was yesterday, which nobody notices. Delete the fallback only once no build
 * in the wild predates the endpoint.
